# porE
PORosity Evaluation tool

Main developer: Kai Trepte


This tool provides a simple way to study porosities in e.g. metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
All that is needed is an xyz-file of the coordinates of the structure and the corresponding cell vectors (see structures_xyz for examples). 


# find_pores
An additional tool is provided, called find_pores.f90 . 
It can be used to determine the pore sizes in a structure and get an estimate of the pore size distribution.
